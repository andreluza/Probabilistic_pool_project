This repository hosts codes used to build a mechanistic null model with sampling by prevalence.
More details in forthcoming publications. By 'mechanistic' I mean a null model that maintains the ecological processes underlying data. 
In this case, the null model sample species by their prevalence in a probabilistic regional pool (i.e., it tends to sort species with higher probability to be locally present). 
The probabilistic pool can be assembled according to species dispersal ability, and site environmental suitability.
